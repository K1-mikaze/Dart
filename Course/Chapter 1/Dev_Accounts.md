## Key Differences:


### **Apple Developer Account vs. Google Play Developer Account**  


| Feature            | Apple Developer Account                        | Google Play Developer Account             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**           | $99/year (Individual/Organization)             | One-time $25 fee                          |
| **App Review**     | Strict manual review (1–3 days, often longer)  | Mostly automated (may reject later)       |
| **Beta Testing**   | TestFlight (max 10,000 external testers)       | Open/Closed Beta (unlimited testers)      |
| **Publishing Time**| 24–72 hours                                    | Few hours (usually <48 hours)             |
| **Enterprise Apps**| ✅ Enterprise Program ($299/year)              | ✅ Managed Google Play                    |
| **Required For**   | App Store distribution, iOS/macOS development  | Google Play distribution, Android apps    |
| **Monetization**   | Paid apps, subscriptions, in-app purchases     | Same + AdMob ads                          |
| **Device Testing** | Required (Simulator limitations)               | Optional (wide device support)            |


Conclusion:

    Need an Apple Developer Account? → If you want to publish on iOS/macOS or use Apple-exclusive features.


    Need a Google Play Account? → If you want to publish Android apps with a one-time fee.

Developers often need both if they’re releasing cross-platform apps (iOS + Android).
